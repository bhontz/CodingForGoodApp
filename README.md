## Girl Scouts of Orange County
**Coding for Good App Badge Event**

This GITHUB repository supports the **GSOC's Coding for Good App Badge event**.  The event was designed to teach 5th grade juniors through senior Girl Scouts above phone app development process and challenges, while allowing the girls to earn the GS Coding for Good - App badge.   The event utilizes the [Thunkable X coding platform](https://thunkable.com/).

We start with an existing Thunkable X project:
https://x.thunkable.com/copy/478ba55b51ae0c917a632b0955aa4541
... and REMIX it.  This saves considerable "cut & paste" and file copying time that would be better used discussing development!

The ASSETS folder within this repository includes all of the files that need to be "browsed in" as file assets for this Thunkable X project.  By remixing the existing project using the URL above, the assets should "come along" with the project, but ff they don't, you can utilize the folder here and browse them into your own project.

Other files in this repository:

**gsappicon.gif**   For some reason, ThunkableX insists you browse the APP icon in as a file, as opposed to from files within the project.

**sndgirlscoutpromise.mp3** The remix project provides a URL reference to a hosted version of this file (Thunkable X requires a URL not a file).  I've included the file here should you wish to rehost it.

**sndgirlscoutlaw.mp3** The remix project provides a URL reference to a hosted version of this file (Thunkable X requires a URL not a file).  I've included the file here should you wish to rehost it.

**EventSlideDeck.pdf**  Event teacher's presentation materials.  Note that you will need considerable discussion above and beyond the content with this deck.

**PaperPrototypingTemplate.pdf** Template that you can distribute to attendees for their Paper Prototype.
